info:
  classification: CVE-2024-44000
  description: 'The LiteSpeed Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive
    Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.1 through the debug.log
    file that is publicly exposed. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to view potentially sensitive information contained in the exposed log file. The
    log file may contain user cookies making it possible for an attacker to log in
    with any session that is actively valid and exposed in the log file. Note: the
    debug feature must be enabled for this to be a concern and this feature is disabled
    by default.
