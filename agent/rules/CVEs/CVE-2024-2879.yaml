  classification: CVE-2024-2879
  description: 'The LayerSlider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection
    via the ls_get_popup_markup action in versions 7.9.11 and 7.10.0 due to insufficient
    escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on
    the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
    to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used
    to extract sensitive information from the database.
