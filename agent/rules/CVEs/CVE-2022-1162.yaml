id: CVE-2022-1162
info:
  classification: CVE-2022-1162
  description: GitLab CE/EE contains a hard-coded credentials vulnerability. A hardcoded
    password was set for accounts registered using an OmniAuth provider (e.g. OAuth,
    LDAP, SAML), allowing attackers to potentially take over accounts. This template
    attempts to passively identify vulnerable versions of GitLab without the need
    for an exploit by matching unique hashes for the application-<hash>.css file in
    the header for unauthenticated requests. Positive matches do not guarantee exploitability.
    Affected versions are 14.7 prior to 14.7.7, 14.8 prior to 14.8.5, and 14.9 prior
    to 14.9.2.
