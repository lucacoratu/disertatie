info:
  classification: CVE-2024-49757
  description: 'The open-source identity infrastructure software Zitadel allows administrators
    to disable the user self-registration. Due to a missing security check in versions
    prior to 2.64.0, 2.63.5, 2.62.7, 2.61.4, 2.60.4, 2.59.5, and 2.58.7, disabling
    the "User Registration allowed" option only hid the registration button on the
    login page. Users could bypass this restriction by directly accessing the registration
    URL (/ui/login/loginname) and register a user that way. Versions 2.64.0, 2.63.5,
    2.62.7, 2.61.4, 2.60.4, 2.59.5, and 2.58.7 contain a patch. No known workarounds
    are available.
