info:
  classification: CVE-2019-12990
  description: 'Citrix SD-WAN Center is susceptible to local file inclusion via the
    applianceSettingsFileTransfer function in ApplianceSettingsController. The function
    does not sufficiently validate or sanitize HTTP request parameter values used
    to construct a file system path. An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by
    routing traffic through the Collector controller and supplying a crafted value
    for filename, filedata, and workspace_id, therefore being able to write files
    to locations writable by the www-data user and/or to write a crafted PHP file
    to /home/talariuser/www/app/webroot/files/ to execute arbitrary PHP code.
