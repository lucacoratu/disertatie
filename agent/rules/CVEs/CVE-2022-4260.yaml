  description: 'WordPress WP-Ban plugin before 1.69.1 contains a stored cross-site
    scripting vulnerability. The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings,
    which can allow high-privilege users to steal cookie-based authentication credentials
    and launch other attacks. This vulnerability can be exploited even when the unfiltered_html
    capability is disallowed, for example in multisite setup.
