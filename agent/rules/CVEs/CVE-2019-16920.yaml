  description: D-Link products such as DIR-655C, DIR-866L, DIR-652, and DHP-1565 contain
    an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability. The issue occurs when
    the attacker sends an arbitrary input to a "PingTest" device common gateway interface
    that could lead to common injection. An attacker who successfully triggers the
    command injection could achieve full system compromise. Later, it was independently
    found that these issues also affected; DIR-855L, DAP-1533, DIR-862L, DIR-615,
    DIR-835, and DIR-825.
