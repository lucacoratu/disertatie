  classification: CVE-2020-5412
  description: Spring Cloud Netflix 2.2.x prior to 2.2.4, 2.1.x prior to 2.1.6, and
    older unsupported versions are susceptible to server-side request forgery. Applications
    can use the Hystrix Dashboard proxy.stream endpoint to make requests to any server
    reachable by the server hosting the dashboard. An attacker can send a request
    to other servers and thus potentially access sensitive information, modify data,
    and/or execute unauthorized operations.
