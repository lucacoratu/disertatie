  description: 'Dragonfly is an open source P2P-based file distribution and image
    acceleration system. It is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)
    as an Incubating Level Project. Dragonfly uses JWT to verify user. However, the
    secret key for JWT, "Secret Key", is hard coded, which leads to authentication
    bypass. An attacker can perform any action as a user with admin privileges. This
    issue has been addressed in release version 2.0.9. All users are advised to upgrade.
    There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
