  description: 'WordPress Events Calendar plugin before 1.4.5 contains multiple cross-site
    scripting vulnerabilities. The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter
    before outputting it back in the page. An attacker can inject arbitrary script
    in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, which
    can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch
    other attacks. This vulnerability can be used against both unauthenticated and
    authenticated users.
