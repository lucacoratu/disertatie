info:
  classification: CVE-2018-10562
  description: Dasan GPON home routers are susceptible to command injection which
    can occur via the dest_host parameter in a diag_action=ping request to a GponForm/diag_Form
    URI. Because the router saves ping results in /tmp and transmits them to the user
    when the user revisits /diag.html, it's quite simple to execute commands and retrieve
    their output.
