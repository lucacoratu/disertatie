id: CVE-2021-38314
info:
  classification: CVE-2021-38314
  description: WordPress Redux Framework plugin through 4.2.11 is susceptible to information
    disclosure. The plugin registers several unique AJAX actions available to unauthenticated
    users in the includes function in redux-core/class-redux-core.php. These are predictable,
    given that they are based on an md5 hash of the site URL with a known salt value
    of -redux and an md5 hash of the previous hash with a known salt value of -support.
    An attacker can potentially employ these AJAX actions to retrieve a list of active
    plugins and their versions, the site's PHP version, and an unsalted md5 hash of
    the site's AUTH_KEY concatenated with the SECURE_AUTH_KEY.
