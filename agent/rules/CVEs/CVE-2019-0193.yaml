  classification: CVE-2019-0193
  description: 'Apache Solr is vulnerable to remote code execution vulnerabilities
    via the DataImportHandler, an optional but popular module to pull in data from
    databases and other sources. The module has a feature in which the whole DIH configuration
    can come from a request''s "dataConfig" parameter. The debug mode of the DIH admin
    screen uses this to allow convenient debugging / development of a DIH config.
    Since a DIH config can contain scripts, this parameter is a security risk.
