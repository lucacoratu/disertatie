id: CVE-2024-8698
info:
  classification: CVE-2024-8698
  description: 'A flaw exists in the SAML signature validation method within the Keycloak
    XMLSignatureUtil class. The method incorrectly determines whether a SAML signature
    is for the full document or only for specific assertions based on the position
    of the signature in the XML document, rather than the Reference element used to
    specify the signed element. This flaw allows attackers to create crafted responses
    that can bypass the validation, potentially leading to privilege escalation or
    impersonation attacks.
