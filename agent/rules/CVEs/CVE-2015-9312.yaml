info:
  classification: CVE-2015-9312
  description: 'WordPress NewStatPress plugin through 1.0.4 contains a cross-site
    scripting vulnerability. The plugin utilizes, on lines 28 and 31 of the file "includes/nsp_search.php",
    several variables from the $_GET scope without sanitation. While WordPress automatically
    escapes quotes on this scope, the outputs on these lines are outside of quotes,
    and as such can be utilized to initiate a cross-site scripting attack.
