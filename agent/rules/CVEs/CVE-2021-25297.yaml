  classification: CVE-2021-25297
  description: 'Nagios XI 5.5.6 through 5.7.5 is susceptible to authenticated remote
    command injection. There is improper sanitization of authenticated user-controlled
    input by a single HTTP request via the file /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/configwizards/switch/switch.inc.php.
    This in turn can lead to remote code execution, by which an attacker can execute
    malware, obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or gain full control over
    a compromised system without entering necessary credentials.
