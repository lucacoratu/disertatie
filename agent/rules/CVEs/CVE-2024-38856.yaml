  description: 'Incorrect Authorization vulnerability in Apache OFBiz. This issue
    affects Apache OFBiz: through 18.12.14. Users are recommended to upgrade to version
    18.12.15, which fixes the issue. Unauthenticated endpoints could allow execution
    of screen rendering code of screens if some preconditions are met (such as when
    the screen definitions don''t explicitly check user''s permissions because they
    rely on the configuration of their endpoints).
