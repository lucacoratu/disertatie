  classification: CVE-2024-39887
  description: 'An SQL Injection vulnerability in Apache Superset exists due to improper
    neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands. Specifically, certain
    engine-specific functions are not checked, which allows attackers to bypass Apache
    Superset''s SQL authorization. To mitigate this, a new configuration key named
    DISALLOWED_SQL_FUNCTIONS has been introduced. This key disallows the use of the
    following PostgreSQL functions- version, query_to_xml, inet_server_addr, and inet_client_addr.
    Additional functions can be added to this list for increased protection.
