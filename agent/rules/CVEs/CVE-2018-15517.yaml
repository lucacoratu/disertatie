info:
  classification: CVE-2018-15517
  description: D-Link Central WifiManager is susceptible to server-side request forgery.
    The MailConnect feature on D-Link Central WiFiManager CWM-100 1.03 r0098 devices
    is intended to check a connection to an SMTP server but actually allows outbound
    TCP to any port on any IP address, as demonstrated by an index.php/System/MailConnect/host/127.0.0.1/port/22/secure/
    URI. This can undermine accountability of where scan or connections actually came
    from and or bypass the FW etc. This can be automated via script or using a browser.
