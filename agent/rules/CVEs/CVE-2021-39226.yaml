  classification: CVE-2021-39226
  description: Grafana instances up to 7.5.11 and 8.1.5 allow remote unauthenticated
    users to view the snapshot associated with the lowest database key by accessing
    the literal paths /api/snapshot/:key or /dashboard/snapshot/:key. If the snapshot
    is in public mode, unauthenticated users can delete snapshots by accessing the
    endpoint /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey. Authenticated users can also delete
    snapshots by accessing the endpoints /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey, or sending
    a delete request to /api/snapshot/:key, regardless of whether or not the snapshot
    is set to public mode (disabled by default).
