id: CVE-2019-11869
info:
  classification: CVE-2019-11869
  description: 'WordPress Yuzo Related Posts plugin before 5.12.94 is vulnerable to
    cross-site scripting

    because it mistakenly expects that is_admin() verifies that the

    request comes from an admin user (it actually only verifies that the

    request is for an admin page). An unauthenticated attacker can consequently inject

    a payload into the plugin settings, such as the

    yuzo_related_post_css_and_style setting.
