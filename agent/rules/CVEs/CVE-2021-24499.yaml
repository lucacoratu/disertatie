info:
  classification: CVE-2021-24499
  description: WordPress Workreap theme is susceptible to remote code execution. The
    AJAX actions workreap_award_temp_file_uploader and workreap_temp_file_uploader
    did not perform nonce checks, or validate that the request is from a valid user
    in any other way. The endpoints allowed for uploading arbitrary files to the uploads/workreap-temp
    directory. Uploaded files were neither sanitized nor validated, allowing an unauthenticated
    visitor to upload executable code such as php scripts.
  name: CVE-2021-24499
