info:
  classification: CVE-2016-8735
  description: 'Apache Tomcat versions before 6.0.48, 7.x before 7.0.73, 8.x before
    8.0.39, 8.5.x before 8.5.7, and 9.x before 9.0.0.M12 are vulnerable to remote
    code execution if JmxRemoteLifecycleListener is used and the JMX ports are exposed
    to attackers. The vulnerability exists due to inconsistent credential type handling,
    which was not aligned with the CVE-2016-3427 Oracle patch. Attackers with access
    to JMX ports can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code remotely.
