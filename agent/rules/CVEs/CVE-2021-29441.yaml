  classification: CVE-2021-29441
  description: 'This template only works on Nuclei engine prior to version 2.3.3 and
    version >= 2.3.5.


    In Nacos before version 1.4.1, when configured to use authentication (-Dnacos.core.auth.enabled=true)

    Nacos uses the AuthFilter servlet filter to enforce authentication. This filter
    has a backdoor that

    enables Nacos servers to bypass this filter and therefore skip authentication
    checks.

    This mechanism relies on the user-agent HTTP header so it can be easily spoofed.

    This issue may allow any user to carry out any administrative tasks on the Nacos
    server.
