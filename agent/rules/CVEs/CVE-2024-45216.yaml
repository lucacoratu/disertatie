  classification: CVE-2024-45216
  description: 'Solr instances using the PKIAuthenticationPlugin, which is enabled
    by default when Solr Authentication is used, are vulnerable to Authentication
    bypass.A fake ending at the end of any Solr API URL path, will allow requests
    to skip Authentication while maintaining the API contract with the original URL
    Path.This fake ending looks like an unprotected API path, however it is stripped
    off internally after authentication but before API routing.This issue affects
    Apache Solr- from 5.3.0 before 8.11.4, from 9.0.0 before 9.7.0.
