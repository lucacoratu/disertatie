  classification: CVE-2022-23544
  description: 'MeterSphere is a one-stop open source continuous testing platform,
    covering test management, interface testing, UI testing and performance testing.
    Versions prior to 2.5.0 are subject to a Server-Side Request Forgery that leads
    to Cross-Site Scripting. A Server-Side request forgery in `IssueProxyResourceService::getMdImageByUrl`
    allows an attacker to access internal resources, as well as executing JavaScript
    code in the context of Metersphere''s origin by a victim of a reflected XSS. This
    vulnerability has been fixed in v2.5.0. There are no known workarounds.
