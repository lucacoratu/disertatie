  classification: CVE-2021-22205
  description: GitLab CE/EE starting from 11.9 does not properly validate image files
    that were passed to a file parser, resulting in a remote command execution vulnerability.
    This template attempts to passively identify vulnerable versions of GitLab without
    the need for an exploit by matching unique hashes for the application-<hash>.css
    file in the header for unauthenticated requests. Positive matches do not guarantee
    exploitability. Tooling to find relevant hashes based on the semantic version
    ranges specified in the CVE is linked in the references section below.
