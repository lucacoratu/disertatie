  classification: CVE-2008-2650
  description: 'CMSimple 3.1 is susceptible to local file inclusion via cmsimple/cms.php
    when register_globals is enabled which allows remote attackers to include and
    execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the sl parameter to index.php.
    NOTE: this can be leveraged for remote file execution by including adm.php and
    then invoking the upload action. NOTE: on 20080601, the vendor patched 3.1 without
    changing the version number.
