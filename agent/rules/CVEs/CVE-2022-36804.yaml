  classification: CVE-2022-36804
  description: 'Atlassian Bitbucket Server and Data Center is susceptible to remote
    command injection. Multiple API endpoints can allow an attacker with read permissions
    to a public or private Bitbucket repository to execute arbitrary code by sending
    a malicious HTTP request, thus making it possible to obtain sensitive information,
    modify data, and/or gain full control over a compromised system without entering
    necessary credentials. Affected versions are 7.0.0 before version 7.6.17, from
    version 7.7.0 before version 7.17.10, from version 7.18.0 before version 7.21.4,
    from version 8.0.0 before version 8.0.3, from version 8.1.0 before version 8.1.3,
    and from version 8.2.0 before version 8.2.2, and from version 8.3.0 before 8.3.1.
