  classification: CVE-2017-15715
  description: Apache httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.29 is susceptible to arbitrary file upload
    vulnerabilities via the expression specified in <FilesMatch>, which could match
    '$' to a newline character in a malicious filename rather than matching only the
    end of the filename. This could be exploited in environments where uploads of
    some files are externally blocked, but only by matching the trailing portion of
    the filename.
