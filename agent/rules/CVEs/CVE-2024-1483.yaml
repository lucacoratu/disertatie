  description: 'A path traversal vulnerability exists in mlflow/mlflow version 2.9.2,
    allowing attackers to access arbitrary files on the server. By crafting a series
    of HTTP POST requests with specially crafted ''artifact_location'' and ''source''
    parameters, using a local URI with ''#'' instead of ''?'', an attacker can traverse
    the server''s directory structure. The issue occurs due to insufficient validation
    of user-supplied input in the server''s handlers.
