  classification: CVE-2019-12988
  description: 'Citrix SD-WAN Center is susceptible to remote command injection via
    the addModifyZTDProxy function in NmsController. The function does not sufficiently
    validate or sanitize HTTP request parameter values that are used to construct
    a shell command. An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by routing traffic
    through the Collector controller and supplying a crafted value for ztd_password,  thereby
    potentially being able to obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute
    unauthorized operations.
