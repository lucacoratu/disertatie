info:
  classification: CVE-2023-22463
  description: 'KubePi is a k8s panel. The jwt authentication function of KubePi through
    version 1.6.2 uses hard-coded Jwtsigkeys, resulting in the same Jwtsigkeys for
    all online projects. This means that an attacker can forge any jwt token to take
    over the administrator account of any online project. Furthermore, they may use
    the administrator to take over the k8s cluster of the target enterprise. `session.go`,
    the use of hard-coded JwtSigKey, allows an attacker to use this value to forge
    jwt tokens arbitrarily. The JwtSigKey is confidential and should not be hard-coded
    in the code.
