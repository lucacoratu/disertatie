info:
  classification: CVE-2019-5434
  description: 'Revive Adserver 4.2 is susceptible to remote code execution. An attacker
    can send a crafted payload to the XML-RPC invocation script and trigger the unserialize()
    call on the "what" parameter in the "openads.spc" RPC method. This can be exploited
    to perform various types of attacks, e.g. serialize-related PHP vulnerabilities
    or PHP object injection. It is possible, although unconfirmed, that the vulnerability
    has been used by some attackers in order to gain access to some Revive Adserver
    instances and deliver malware through them to third-party websites.
