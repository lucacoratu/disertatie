  description: Prometheus 2.23.0 through 2.26.0 and 2.27.0 contains an open redirect
    vulnerability. To ensure a seamless transition to 2.27.0, the default UI was changed
    to the new UI with a URL prefixed by /new redirect to /. Due to a bug in the code,
    an attacker can redirect a user to a malicious site and possibly obtain sensitive
    information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized operations.
