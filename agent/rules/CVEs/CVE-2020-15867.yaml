  classification: CVE-2020-15867
  description: 'Gogs 0.5.5 through 0.12.2 is susceptible to authenticated remote code
    execution via the git hooks functionality. There can be a privilege escalation
    if access to this feature is granted to a user who does not have administrative
    privileges. NOTE: Since this is mentioned in the documentation but not in the
    UI, it could be considered a "product UI does not warn user of unsafe actions"
    issue.
