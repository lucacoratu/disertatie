    vulnerability. The plugin does not sanitize and escape the form_id parameter before
    returning it in the response of an unauthenticated request via the give_checkout_login
    AJAX action. An attacker can inject arbitrary script in the browser of a user
    in the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based
    authentication credentials and launch other attacks.
