    is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the ''visit_type[service_id]'' parameter of
    the tax_calculated_data AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.4
    due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient
    preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
