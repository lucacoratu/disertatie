  classification: CVE-2019-13392
  description: MindPalette NateMail 3.0.15 is susceptible to reflected cross-site
    scripting which could allows an attacker to execute remote JavaScript in a victim's
    browser via a specially crafted POST request. The application will reflect the
    recipient value if it is not in the NateMail recipient array. Note that this array
    is keyed via integers by default, so any string input will be invalid.
