info:
  classification: CVE-2017-12615
  description: 'Apache Tomcat servers 7.0.{0 to 79} are susceptible to remote code
    execution. By design, you are not allowed to upload JSP files via the PUT method.
    This is likely a security measure to prevent an attacker from uploading a JSP
    shell and gaining remote code execution on the server. However, due to the insufficient
    checks, an attacker could gain remote code execution on Apache Tomcat servers
    that have enabled PUT method by using a specially crafted HTTP request.
