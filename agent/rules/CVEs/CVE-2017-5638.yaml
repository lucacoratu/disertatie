  classification: CVE-2017-5638
  description: 'Apache Struts 2.3.x before 2.3.32 and 2.5.x before 2.5.10.1 is susceptible
    to remote command injection attacks. The Jakarta Multipart parser has incorrect
    exception handling and error-message generation during file upload attempts, which
    can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted Content-Type,
    Content-Disposition, or Content-Length HTTP header. This was exploited in March
    2017 with a Content-Type header containing a #cmd= string.
