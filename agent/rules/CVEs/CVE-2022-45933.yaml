  classification: CVE-2022-45933
  description: 'KubeView through 0.1.31 is susceptible to information disclosure.
    An attacker can obtain control of a Kubernetes cluster because api/scrape/kube-system
    does not require authentication and retrieves certificate files that can be used
    for authentication as kube-admin. An attacker can thereby possibly obtain sensitive
    information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized operations.
