  classification: CVE-2020-14413
  description: NeDi 1.9C is vulnerable to cross-site scripting because of an incorrect
    implementation of sanitize() in inc/libmisc.php. This function attempts to escape
    the SCRIPT tag from user-controllable values, but can be easily bypassed, as demonstrated
    by an onerror attribute of an IMG element as a Devices-Config.php?sta= value.
