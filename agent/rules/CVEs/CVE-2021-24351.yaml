  classification: CVE-2021-24351
  description: 'WordPress The Plus Addons for Elementor plugin before 4.1.12 is susceptible
    to cross-site scripting. The plugin does not properly sanitize some of its fields
    in the heplus_more_post AJAX action, which is exploitable by both unauthenticated
    and authenticated users. An attacker can inject arbitrary script in the browser
    of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This can allow the
    attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.
