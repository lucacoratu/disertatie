  classification: CVE-2021-28918
  description: Netmask NPM Package is susceptible to server-side request forgery because
    of improper input validation of octal strings in netmask npm package. This allows
    unauthenticated remote attackers to perform indeterminate SSRF, remote file inclusion,
    and local file inclusion attacks on many of the dependent packages. A remote unauthenticated
    attacker can bypass packages relying on netmask to filter IPs and reach critical
    VPN or LAN hosts.
