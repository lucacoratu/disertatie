  description: 'The LearnPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Command Injection
    in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.5.7 via the get_content function. This

    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute any public function
    with one parameter, which could result in remote code execution.
