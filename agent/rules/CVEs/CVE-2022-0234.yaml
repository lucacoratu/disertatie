  classification: CVE-2022-0234
  description: 'WordPress WOOCS plugin before 1.3.7.5 is susceptible to cross-site
    scripting. The plugin does not sanitize and escape the woocs_in_order_currency
    parameter of the woocs_get_products_price_html AJAX action, available to both
    unauthenticated and authenticated users, before outputting it back in the response.
    An attacker can inject arbitrary script in the browser of an unsuspecting user
    in the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based
    authentication credentials and launch other attacks.
