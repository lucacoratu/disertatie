    vulnerable to SQL Injection via the ''onesignal_externalid'' and ''onesignal_get_subscriptionoptions_id''
    paramters in all versions up to, and including, 1.93 due to insufficient escaping
    on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing
    SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional
