  classification: CVE-2024-3136
  description: The MasterStudy LMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File
    Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.3 via the 'template' parameter.
    This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary
    files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This
    can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code
    execution in cases where  images and other "safe" file types can be uploaded and
    included.
