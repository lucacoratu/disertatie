  description: 'The Tenda AC1200 V-W15Ev2 router is affected by improper authorization/improper
    session management. The software does not perform or incorrectly perform an authorization
    check when a user attempts to access a resource or perform an action. This allows
    the router''s login page to be bypassed. The improper validation of user sessions/authorization
    can lead to unauthenticated attackers having the ability to read the router''s
    file, which contains the MD5 password of the Administrator''s user account. This
    vulnerability exists within the local web and hosted remote management console.
