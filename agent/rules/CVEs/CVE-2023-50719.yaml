  classification: CVE-2023-50719
  description: 'XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in 7.2-milestone-2
    and prior to versions 14.10.15, 15.5.2, and 15.7-rc-1, the Solr-based search in
    XWiki discloses the password hashes of all users to anyone with view right on
    the respective user profiles. By default, all user profiles are public. This vulnerability
    also affects any configurations used by extensions that contain passwords like
    API keys that are viewable for the attacker. Normally, such passwords aren''t
    accessible but this vulnerability would disclose them as plain text. This has
    been patched in XWiki 14.10.15, 15.5.2 and 15.7RC1. There are no known workarounds
    for this vulnerability.
