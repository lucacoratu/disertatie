info:
  classification: CVE-2020-14144
  description: 'Gitea 1.1.0 through 1.12.5 is susceptible to authenticated remote
    code execution, via the git hook functionality, in customer environments where
    the documentation is not understood (e.g., one viewpoint is that the dangerousness
    of this feature should be documented immediately above the ENABLE_GIT_HOOKS line
    in the config file). NOTE: The vendor has indicated this is not a vulnerability
    and states "This is a functionality of the software that is limited to a subset
    of accounts. If you give someone the privilege to execute arbitrary code on your
    server, they can execute arbitrary code on your server. We provide very clear
    warnings to users around this functionality and what it provides."
