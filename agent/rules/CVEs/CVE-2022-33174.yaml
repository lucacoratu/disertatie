  classification: CVE-2022-33174
  description: 'Powertek firmware (multiple brands) before 3.30.30 running Power Distribution
    Units are vulnerable to authorization bypass in the web interface. To exploit
    the vulnerability, an attacker must send an HTTP packet to the data retrieval
    interface (/cgi/get_param.cgi) with the tmpToken cookie set to an empty string
    followed by a semicolon. This bypasses an active session authorization check.
    This can be then used to fetch the values of protected sys.passwd and sys.su.name
    fields that contain the username and password in cleartext.
