  description: 'WordPress Narnoo Distributor plugin 2.5.1 and prior is susceptible
    to local file inclusion. The plugin does not validate and sanitize the lib_path
    parameter before being passed into a call to require() via the narnoo_distributor_lib_request
    AJAX action, and the content of the file is displayed in the response as JSON
    data. This can also lead to a remote code execution vulnerability depending on
    system and configuration.
