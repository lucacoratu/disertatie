info:
  classification: CVE-2018-12613
  description: PhpMyAdmin before version 4.8.2 is susceptible to local file inclusion
    that allows an attacker to include (view and potentially execute) files on the
    server. The vulnerability comes from a portion of code where pages are redirected
    and loaded within phpMyAdmin, and an improper test for whitelisted pages. An attacker
    must be authenticated, except in the "$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer'] = true" case
    (where an attacker can specify any host he/she is already in control of, and execute
    arbitrary code on phpMyAdmin) and the "$cfg['ServerDefault'] = 0" case (which
    bypasses the login requirement and runs the vulnerable code without any authentication).
