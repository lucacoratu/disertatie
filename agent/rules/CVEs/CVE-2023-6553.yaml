  classification: CVE-2023-6553
  description: 'The Backup Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote
    Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.7 via the /includes/backup-heart.php
    file. This is due to an attacker being able to control the values passed to an
    include, and subsequently leverage that to achieve remote code execution. This
    makes it possible for unauthenticated threat actors to easily execute code on
    the server.
