    SQL Injection via the ''order'' parameter of the /wp-json/watch-life-net/v1/comment/getcomments
    REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 4.7.1 due to insufficient
    escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on
    the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
    append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to
    extract sensitive information from the database.
