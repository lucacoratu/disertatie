info:
  classification: CVE-2022-24112
  description: A default configuration of Apache APISIX (with default API key) is
    vulnerable to remote code execution. An attacker can abuse the batch-requests
    plugin to send requests to bypass the IP restriction of Admin API. When the admin
    key was changed or the port of Admin API was changed to a port different from
    the data panel, the impact is lower. But there is still a risk to bypass the IP
    restriction of Apache APISIX's data panel. There is a check in the batch-requests
    plugin which overrides the client IP with its real remote IP. But due to a bug
    in the code, this check can be bypassed.
