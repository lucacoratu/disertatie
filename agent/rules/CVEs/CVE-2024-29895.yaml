  classification: CVE-2024-29895
  description: 'Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework.
    A command injection vulnerability on the 1.3.x DEV branch allows any unauthenticated
    user to execute arbitrary command on the server when `register_argc_argv` option
    of PHP is `On`. In `cmd_realtime.php` line 119, the `$poller_id` used as part
    of the command execution is sourced from `$_SERVER[''argv'']`, which can be controlled
    by URL when `register_argc_argv` option of PHP is `On`. And this option is `On`
    by default in many environments such as the main PHP Docker image for PHP.
