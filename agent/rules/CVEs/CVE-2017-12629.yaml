info:
  classification: CVE-2017-12629
  description: Apache Solr with Apache Lucene before 7.1 is susceptible to remote
    code execution by exploiting XXE in conjunction with use of a Config API add-listener
    command to reach the RunExecutableListener class. Elasticsearch, although it uses
    Lucene, is NOT vulnerable to this. Note that the XML external entity expansion
    vulnerability occurs in the XML Query Parser which is available, by default, for
    any query request with parameters deftype=xmlparser and can be exploited to upload
    malicious data to the /upload request handler or as Blind XXE using ftp wrapper
    in order to read arbitrary local files from the Solr server. Note also that the
    second vulnerability relates to remote code execution using the RunExecutableListener
    available on all affected versions of Solr.
