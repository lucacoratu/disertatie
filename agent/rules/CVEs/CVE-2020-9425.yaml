  classification: CVE-2020-9425
  description: rConfig prior to version 3.9.4 is susceptible to sensitive information
    disclosure. An unauthenticated attacker can retrieve saved cleartext credentials
    via a GET request to settings.php. Because the application does not exit after
    a redirect is applied, the rest of the page still executes, resulting in the disclosure
    of cleartext credentials in the response.
