  classification: CVE-2023-29204
  description: 'XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top
    level XWiki projects. It is possible to bypass the existing security measures
    put in place to avoid open redirect by using a redirect such as `//mydomain.com`
    (i.e. omitting the `http:`). It was also possible to bypass it when using URL
    such as `http:/mydomain.com`. The problem has been patched on XWiki 13.10.10,
    14.4.4 and 14.8RC1.
