info:
  classification: CVE-2021-20323
  description: 'Keycloak 10.0.0 to 18.0.0 contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability
    via the client-registrations endpoint. On a POST request, the application does
    not sanitize an unknown attribute name before including it in the error response
    with a ''Content-Type'' of text/hml. Once reflected, the response is interpreted
    as HTML. This can be performed on any realm present on the Keycloak instance.
    Since the bug requires Content-Type application/json and is submitted via a POST,
    there is no common path to exploit that has a user impact.
