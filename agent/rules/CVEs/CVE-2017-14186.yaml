  classification: CVE-2017-14186
  description: 'FortiGate FortiOS through SSL VPN Web Portal contains a cross-site
    scripting vulnerability. The login redir parameter is not sanitized, so an attacker
    can inject arbitrary script in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context
    of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication
    credentials and launch other attacks such as a URL redirect. Affected versions
    are 6.0.0 to 6.0.4, 5.6.0 to 5.6.7, and 5.4 and below.
