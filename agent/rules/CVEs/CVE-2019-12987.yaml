info:
  classification: CVE-2019-12987
  description: 'Citrix SD-WAN Center is susceptible to remote command injection via
    the apply action in StorageMgmtController. The callStoragePerl function does not
    sufficiently validate or sanitize HTTP request parameter values that are used
    to construct a shell command. An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by routing
    traffic through the Collector controller and supplying an array value with crafted
    values for action, host, path, or type, thereby potentially being able to obtain
    sensitive information, modify data, and/or execute unauthorized operations.
