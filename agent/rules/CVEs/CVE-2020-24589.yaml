  description: WSO2 API Manager 3.1.0 and earlier is vulnerable to blind XML external
    entity injection (XXE). XXE often allows an attacker to view files on the server

    itself can access which allows the attacker to transmit sensitive data from the
    compromised server to a system that the attacker controls.
