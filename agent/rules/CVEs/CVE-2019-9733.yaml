id: CVE-2019-9733
info:
  classification: CVE-2019-9733
  description: JFrog Artifactory 6.7.3 is vulnerable to an admin login bypass issue
    because by default the access-admin account is used to reset the password of the
    admin account. While this is only allowable from a connection directly from localhost,
    providing an X-Forwarded-For HTTP header to the request allows an unauthenticated
    user to login with the default credentials of the access-admin account while bypassing
    the whitelist of allowed IP addresses. The access-admin account can use Artifactory's
    API to request authentication tokens for all users including the admin account
    and, in turn, assume full control of all artifacts and repositories managed by
    Artifactory.
