  classification: CVE-2020-13379
  description: 'Grafana 3.0.1 through 7.0.1 is susceptible to server-side request
    forgery via the avatar feature, which can lead to remote code execution. Any unauthenticated
    user/client can make Grafana send HTTP requests to any URL and return its result.
    This can be used to gain information about the network Grafana is running on,
    thereby potentially enabling an attacker to obtain sensitive information, modify
    data, and/or execute unauthorized administrative operations in the context of
    the affected site.
