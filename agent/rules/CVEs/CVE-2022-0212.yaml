  classification: CVE-2022-0212
  description: 'WorsPress Spider Calendar plugin through 1.5.65 is susceptible to
    cross-site scripting. The plugin does not sanitize and escape the callback parameter
    before outputting it back in the page via the window AJAX action, available to
    both unauthenticated and authenticated users. An attacker can inject arbitrary
    script in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site.
    This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and
    launch other attacks.
