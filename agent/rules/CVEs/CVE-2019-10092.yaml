  classification: CVE-2019-10092
  description: Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.39 are vulnerable to
    a limited cross-site scripting issue affecting the mod_proxy error page. An attacker
    could cause the link on the error page to be malformed and instead point to a
    page of their choice. This would only be exploitable where a server was set up
    with proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error
    page was displayed.
