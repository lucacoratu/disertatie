  description: 'Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor Vulnerability
    in Apache Solr.

    The Solr Metrics API publishes all unprotected environment variables available
    to each Apache Solr instance. Users can specify which environment variables to
    hide, however, the default list is designed to work for known secret Java system
    properties. Environment variables cannot be strictly defined in Solr, like Java
    system properties can be, and may be set for the entire host,unlike Java system
    properties which are set per-Java-proccess.
