    vulnerability. The plugin does not sanitize and escape the reset_key and user_id
    parameters before outputting then back in attributes. An attacker can inject arbitrary
    script in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site,
    which can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials
    and launch other attacks. This vulnerability can be used against high-privilege
    users such as admin.
