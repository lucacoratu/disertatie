    Injection via the ''order_by'' parameter in all versions up to, and including,
    4.2.5.7 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of
    sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
    attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that
    can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
