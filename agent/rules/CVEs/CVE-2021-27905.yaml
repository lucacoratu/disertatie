  classification: CVE-2021-27905
  description: Apache Solr versions 8.8.1 and prior contain a server-side request
    forgery vulnerability. The ReplicationHandler (normally registered at "/replication"
    under a Solr core) in Apache Solr has a "masterUrl" (also "leaderUrl" alias) parameter
    that is used to designate another ReplicationHandler on another Solr core to replicate
    index data into the local core. To prevent a SSRF vulnerability, Solr ought to
    check these parameters against a similar configuration it uses for the "shards"
    parameter.
