  classification: CVE-2023-0968
  description: 'WordPress Watu Quiz plugin before 3.3.9.1 is susceptible to cross-site
    scripting. The plugin does not sanitize and escape some parameters, such as email,
    dn, date, and points, before outputting then back in a page. An attacker can inject
    arbitrary script in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the
    affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication
    credentials and launch other attacks. This exploit can be used against high-privilege
    users such as admin.
