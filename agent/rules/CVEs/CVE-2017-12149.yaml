  classification: CVE-2017-12149
  description: Jboss Application Server as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Application
    Platform 5.2 is susceptible to a remote code execution vulnerability because  the
    doFilter method in the ReadOnlyAccessFilter of the HTTP Invoker does not restrict
    classes for which it performs deserialization, thus allowing an attacker to execute
    arbitrary code via crafted serialized data.
