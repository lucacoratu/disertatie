info:
  classification: CVE-2019-17558
  description: Apache Solr versions 5.0.0 to 8.3.1 are vulnerable to remote code execution
    vulnerabilities through the VelocityResponseWriter. A Velocity template can be
    provided through Velocity templates in a configset `velocity/ directory or as
    a parameter. A user defined configset could contain renderable, potentially malicious,
    templates. Parameter provided templates are disabled by default, but can be enabled
    by setting `params.resource.loader.enabled by defining a response writer with
    that setting set to `true`. Defining a response writer requires configuration
    API access. Solr 8.4 removed the params resource loader entirely, and only enables
    the configset-provided template rendering when the configset is `trusted` (has
    been uploaded by an authenticated user).
