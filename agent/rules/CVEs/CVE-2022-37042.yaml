  classification: CVE-2022-37042
  description: 'Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) 8.8.15 and 9.0 has mboximport functionality
    that receives a ZIP archive and extracts files from it. By bypassing authentication
    (i.e., not having an authtoken), an attacker can upload arbitrary files to the
    system, leading to directory traversal and remote code execution. NOTE: this issue
    exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2022-27925.
