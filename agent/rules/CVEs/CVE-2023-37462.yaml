info:
  classification: CVE-2023-37462
  description: 'XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
    for applications built on top of it. Improper escaping in the document `SkinsCode.XWikiSkinsSheet`
    leads to an injection vector from view right on that document to programming rights,
    or in other words, it is possible to execute arbitrary script macros including
    Groovy and Python macros that allow remote code execution including unrestricted
    read and write access to all wiki contents. The attack works by opening a non-existing
    page with a name crafted to contain a dangerous payload. It is possible to check
    if an existing installation is vulnerable
