info:
  classification: CVE-2021-29442
  description: 'Nacos before version 1.4.1 is vulnerable to authentication bypass
    because the ConfigOpsController lets the user perform management operations like
    querying the database or even wiping it out. While the /data/remove endpoint is
    properly protected with the @Secured annotation, the /derby endpoint is not protected
    and can be openly accessed by unauthenticated users. These endpoints are only
    valid when using embedded storage (derby DB) so this issue should not affect those
    installations using external storage (e.g. mysql).
