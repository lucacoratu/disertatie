info:
  classification: CVE-2020-3452
  description: 'Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower
    Threat Defense (FTD) Software is vulnerable to local file inclusion due to directory
    traversal attacks that can read sensitive files on a targeted system because of
    a lack of proper input validation of URLs in HTTP requests processed by an affected
    device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP
    request containing directory traversal character sequences to an affected device.
    A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view arbitrary files within the
    web services file system on the targeted device. The web services file system
    is enabled when the affected device is configured with either WebVPN or AnyConnect
    features. This vulnerability cannot be used to obtain access to ASA or FTD system
    files or underlying operating system (OS) files.
