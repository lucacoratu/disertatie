  classification: CVE-2023-6114
  description: 'The Duplicator WordPress plugin before 1.5.7.1, Duplicator Pro WordPress
    plugin before 4.5.14.2 does not disallow listing the `backups-dup-lite/tmp` directory
    (or the `backups-dup-pro/tmp` directory in the Pro version), which temporarily
    stores files containing sensitive data. When directory listing is enabled in the
    web server, this allows unauthenticated attackers to discover and access these
    sensitive files, which include a full database dump and a zip archive of the site.
