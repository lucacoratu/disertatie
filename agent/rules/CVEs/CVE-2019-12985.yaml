info:
  classification: CVE-2019-12985
  description: 'Citrix SD-WAN Center is susceptible to remote command injection via
    the ping function in DiagnosticsController, which does not sufficiently validate
    or sanitize HTTP request parameter values used to construct a shell command. An
    attacker can trigger this vulnerability by routing traffic through the Collector
    controller and supplying a crafted value for ipAddress, pingCount, or packetSize,
    thereby potentially being able to obtain sensitive information, modify data, and/or
    execute unauthorized operations.
