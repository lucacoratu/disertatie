    scripting. The plugin does not sanitize the invitaion_code GET parameter when
    outputting it in the Activation Code page. An attacker can inject arbitrary script
    in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, which
    can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch
    other attacks.
