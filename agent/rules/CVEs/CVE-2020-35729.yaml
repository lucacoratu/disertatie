info:
  classification: CVE-2020-35729
  description: Klog Server 2.4.1 and prior is susceptible to an unauthenticated command
    injection vulnerability. The `authenticate.php` file uses the `user` HTTP POST
    parameter in a call to the `shell_exec()` PHP function without appropriate input
    validation, allowing arbitrary command execution as the apache user. The sudo
    configuration permits the Apache user to execute any command as root without providing
    a password, resulting in privileged command execution as root. Originated from
    Metasploit module, copyright (c) space-r7.
