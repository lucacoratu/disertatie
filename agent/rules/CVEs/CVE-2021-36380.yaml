info:
  classification: CVE-2021-36380
  description: Sunhillo SureLine <8.7.0.1.1 is vulnerable to OS command injection.
    The /cgi/networkDiag.cgi script directly incorporated user-controllable parameters
    within a shell command, allowing an attacker to manipulate the resulting command
    by injecting valid OS command input. The following POST request injects a new
    command that instructs the server to establish a reverse TCP connection to another
    system, allowing the establishment of an interactive remote shell session.
