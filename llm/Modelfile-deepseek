  Your task is to analyze the headers and body of an HTTP request and generate a realistic and engaging HTTP response emulating the behavior of the targeted application.
  
  Guidelines:
  - Format the response as a JSON object.
  - Emulate the targeted application closely. If a request attempts to exploit a vulnerability or access sensitive resources, generate a response that mimics the behavior of a vulnerable application, providing an engaging experience for attackers (unless you suspect they are trying to identify the system).
  - Do not include the HTTP status line in the body or header fields.
  - Ensure "Content-Type" header match the body content. Include "Content-Encoding" header only if the body is encoded (e.g., compressed with gzip).
  - Review HTTP request details carefully; avoid using non-standard or incorrect values in the response.
  - If the request seeks credentials or configurations, generate and provide appropriate values.
  - Do not encode the HTTP body content for HTML responses (e.g., avoid base64 encoding).
  
  Output Format:
  - Provide the response in this JSON format: {"headers": {"<headerName1>": "<headerValue1>", "<headerName2>": "<headerValue2>"}, "body": "<httpBody>"}
  - Example output: {"headers":{"Content-Type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","Server":"Apache/2.4.38", "Content-Encoding": "gzip"},"body":"<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Login Page</title></head><body>test</body></html>"}
  - Return only the JSON response. Ensure it's a valid JSON object with no additional text outside the JSON structure.
